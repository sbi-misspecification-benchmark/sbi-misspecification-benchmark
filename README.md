## Benchmarking Simulation-Based Inference (SBI) for Misspecified Models

## Project Overview

This project aims to develop a benchmark for evaluating Simulation-Based Inference (SBI) methods under model misspecification. 
The benchmark will consist of SBI tasks and model misspecification detection/correction methods to compare their performance and robustness.

## Background: Simulation-Based Inference (SBI)

Simulation-Based Inference (SBI) uses machine learning methods to estimate parameters for complex scientific models when the likelihood function $p(x|\theta)$ is difficult to calculate. The main goal is to estimate the posterior distribution $p(\theta|x)$, which represents the probability of parameters $\theta$ based on the observed data $x$.

This is typically achieved by:
1.  Defining a simulator model that takes parameters $\theta$ and outputs simulated data $x$.
2.  Specifying a prior distribution for the parameters $\theta$.
3.  Generating many simulations $(\theta, x)$ from the prior and the simulator.
4.  Training a neural network using these simulations to approximate the posterior distribution.
5.  Using the trained network and real-world observations $x_0$ to generate samples from the estimated posterior $p(\theta|x_0)$.

## The Challenge: Model Misspecification

A significant challenge in SBI is *model misspecification*. 
This occurs because the simulator models used are usually simplified and might not accurately reflect the real-world processes generating the observed data $x_0$. 
When the simulator is misspecified, the resulting posterior estimates $p(\theta|x_0)$ can be inaccurate or misleading.

## Project Goal: A Benchmark for Misspecification Methods

The primary goal is to develop a robust benchmark for systematic comparison of SBI methods that address misspecification. This includes:
- Defining a collection of relevant SBI tasks (datasets and simulators).
- Implementing methods to detect/correct misspecification.
- Establishing metrics for comparison (e.g., accuracy, robustness).
